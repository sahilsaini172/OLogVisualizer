OLogVisualizer
A modern web application built with React and Vite to visualize and understand algorithm time complexities (Big O notation) through interactive animations and visual representations.

Overview
OLogVisualizer helps developers and students understand algorithmic complexity by providing real-time visualizations of how different algorithms perform as input size grows. The project demonstrates various Big O complexities including O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), and O(2ⁿ) through interactive charts and animations.

Features
Interactive Visualizations: Real-time graphical representations of algorithm complexities

Multiple Complexity Classes: Visual comparison of common Big O notations

Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing experiences

Fast Development: Built with Vite for lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

Modern React: Utilizes latest React patterns and best practices

Tech Stack
React: Frontend UI library for building interactive user interfaces

Vite: Next-generation frontend build tool for faster development

JavaScript: Primary programming language (87.4%)

CSS: Styling and animations (8.3%)

HTML: Markup structure (4.3%)
